# Project Title

Implementation of an AVL Tree in JS, made for university project.

## Brief description

App lets you **insert**, **remove** and **find** a node in AVL Tree which is a type of self-balancing BST.
It also displays some useful info about the tree and has an implementation of Depth-First Searches.
It's been written based on **Object-Oriented Programming** principles.

### Prerequisites

I have nodemon installed globally, so it's not appearing in dev dependencies.
For an app to work properly, you should run:

```
npm i nodemon -g
```

### Installing

After cloning this repository, in the project directory, you should run:

```
npm start
```

Then go to your browser of choice and go to the URL below:

```
localhost:3000
```

App should be running in your browser. Give it a try!

## Built With

* [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) - Drawing JS library based on [Processing](https://processing.org/)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Web framework for [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Further development

* Adding unit tests with **Jest** (already installed)
* Making an animation section actually work as expected

## Acknowledgments

* Shoutout to one an only [Daniel Shiffman](https://github.com/shiffman), from whom I borrowed an approach how to draw a BST
* Shoutout to [I LO w Tarnowie](http://eduinf.waw.pl/inf/alg/001_search/index.php) which has the best explanation of algorithms and basic data structures available (Polish only)
